Virtual camera application.

## User Guide

1. The application starts with the main window being launched. As shown in the
   image below, there are two different buttons; the image icon on the left side,
   which is the import image button, and the cog icon on the right side, which is the
   settings button.

2. If the user clicks the settings button, a new window will pop-up; we’ll call this the
   settings window. The settings window currently contains three options: camera
   preview that toggles the preview display of your camera, gesture control that
   toggles control of gestures over the virtual images, and hand landmarks that
   toggles the display of landmarks.

3. On the other hand, if the user clicks the settings button, a new window will popup; we’ll call this the import image window. The import image window contains
   different icons, as shown in the image below. These icons are premade images
   that are presented as icons that can be displayed within the virtual camera.
   These premade images are also categorized by whether an icon is a letter that is
   part of the alphabet or a shape. On the other hand, the user can also import their
   desired image which is installed on the user’s computer just by clicking the
   image with the plus icon on the bottom leftmost part of the import image
   window.

4. If a virtual image is displayed within the camera, you can now use gestures to
   interact with it. To be able to drag virtual images, you need to mimic the peace
   hand sign, but instead of having space between the middle finger and the index
   finger, you put them close together. The application will then turn the point
   between your middle finger and your index finger, which is the midpoint, into a
   cursor or pointer. After that, if you position the said midpoint under a virtual
   image, you will now be able to drag it.

5. To be able to delete virtual images, you need to do the “D” hand sign with either
   your left or right hand. After doing the said hand sign, you need to do the pointing
   gesture on the other hand. The application will then make your other hand’s index
   finger its cursor or pointer for deleting a virtual image. So, from there, if you
   position your other hand’s index finger under the virtual image, it will be deleted.

6. To be able to resize virtual images, you need to do the dragging gesture, which
   was mentioned earlier, with either your left or right hand. After doing the said
   hand gesture with that specific hand (e.g., left hand). You need to position the
   hand that is currently doing the dragging gesture at either the bottom left or the
   bottom right of the virtual image. This will then tell the application that the virtual
   image is ready to be resized. After that, you now need to do the pointing gesture
   with the other hand. You need to position it on the opposite side of where you
   positioned your first hand, which is also currently doing the dragging gesture
   (e.g., the dragging gesture hand is in the bottom left part of the virtual image and
   the pointing gesture hand is in the top right part of the virtual image.). After doing
   the dragging and pointing gestures, and positioning both hands on their
   respective areas on the virtual image in both hands, you can now resize the
   image by moving your hands close together if you want to make the virtual image
   smaller, or moving your hands away from each other if you want to make the
   virtual image larger.
